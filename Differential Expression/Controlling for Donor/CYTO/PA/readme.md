# Cell Types vs. PA
These folders contain the list of up/down regulated genes when comparing Aria/Aria_S2/TYTO_S2 vs. PA cell type. The results captures all genes that display a log2 Fold Change above/below 0.05 (genes are at least 1.4 times more or less expressed compared to PA). The results have been statistically filtered according to an adjusted pvalue of 0.1  

# Up_Regulated.pdf
This heatmap shows the top upregulated genes differentially expressed across Aria, Aria_S2 and TYTO_S2 vs. PA. These genes were captured by meeting the following criteria: must have a Padj value of > 0.1 and a log2 fold change of 1.

Red cells indicate the gene is upregulated, Blue cells indicate it is downregulated. Yellow cells may indicate the absense of a gene. Therefore this is most useful to to check which genes are upregulated across cell types.

# Down_Regulated.pdf
This heatmap shows the top downregulated genes differentially expressed across Aria, Aria_S2 and TYTO_S2 vs. PA. These genes were captured by meeting the following criteria: must have a Padj value of > 0.1 and a log2 fold change of -1.

Red cells indicate the gene is upregulated, Blue cells indicate it is downregulated. Yellow cells may indicate the absense of a gene. Therefore this is most useful to to check which genes are downregulated across cell types.
