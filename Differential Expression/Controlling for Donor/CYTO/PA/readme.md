# Cell Types vs. PA
These folders contain the list of up/down regulated genes when comparing Aria/Aria_S2/TYTO_S2 vs. PA cell type. The results captures all genes that display a log2 Fold Change above/below 0.05 (genes are at least 1.4 times more or less expressed compared to PA). The results have been statistically filtered according to an adjusted pvalue of 0.05. This means that there is a 5% chance that a result is a false positive. The results are thus statistically significant.  

# Significant_Genes.pdf
This heatmap shows the top 100 statistically significant differentially expressed genes (Padj 0.05) across Aria, Aria_S2 and TYTO_S2 vs. PA. 

# Up_Regulated.pdf
This heatmap shows the top upregulated genes differentially expressed across Aria, Aria_S2 and TYTO_S2 vs. PA. This is useful to see which genes are upregulated in one cell type, but may not be in another. These genes were captured by meeting the following criteria: must have a Padj value of > 0.1 (10% chance the result is a False positive)
