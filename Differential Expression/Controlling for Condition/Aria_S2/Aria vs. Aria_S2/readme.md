# KEGG Pathway analysis
| Signalling Pathway | HSA acc. number |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| MAPK               | 04010           |
| Neuroactive Ligand Receptor Interaction           | 04080           |
| WNT     | 04310           |

To generate KEGG pathways, a greedy approach was used, using a pvalue of 0.1. **These results are not statistically significant!**
