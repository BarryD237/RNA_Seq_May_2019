# KEGG Pathway analysis
| Signalling Pathway | HSA acc. number |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| Caridiac Muscle Contraction               | 04620           |
| Natural Killer Cell Mediated Cytotoxicity           | 04650           |
| Insulin Secretion     | 04911           |

To generate KEGG pathways, a greedy approach was used, using a pvalue of 0.1. **These results are not statistically significant!**
