# KEGG Pathway analysis
| Signalling Pathway         | HSA acc. number |
|----------------------------|-----------------|
| PPAR                       | 03320           |
| Cardiac Muscle Contraction | 04260           |
| Complement + Coagulation Cascades   | 04610           |

To generate KEGG pathways, a greedy approach was used, using a pvalue of 0.1. **These results are not statistically significant!**
