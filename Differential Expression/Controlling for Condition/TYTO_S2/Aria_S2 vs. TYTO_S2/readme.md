# KEGG Pathway analysis
| Signalling Pathway | HSA acc. number |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| Cardiac Muscle Contraction               | 04260           |
| Complement + Coagulation Cascades           | 04610           |
| Gastric Acid Secretion     | 04971           |

To generate KEGG pathways, a greedy approach was used, using a pvalue of 0.1. **These results are not statistically significant!**
