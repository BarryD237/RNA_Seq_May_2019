# KEGG Pathway analysis
| Signalling Pathway | HSA acc. number |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| MAPK               | 04010           |
| PI3K-ATK           | 04151           |
| Focal Adhesion     | 04510           |

To generate KEGG pathways, a greedy approach was used, using a pvalue of 0.1. **These results are not statistically significant!**
