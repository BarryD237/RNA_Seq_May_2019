## Qualoty Control
The quality control folder contains a PDF report on the detection of sample outliers, using PCA. 


## Differential Expression
The Differential Expression folder contains all cell type comparisons for both Control and CYTO treatments. Results are subject to filtering of Log2 Fold Change +/- 1 (i.e genes are expressed at least twice as much -- 2^1) and a FDR (adjusted pvalue) of 0.1. The results in these folders can be deemed stastistically significant.
